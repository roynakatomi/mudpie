Python with MS_Access

27-Jun-2024-Thu 


By using Python 3.9.6, We made a Code that reads and Displays the Contents (Records) on a Microsoft Access 2000 MDB File.

This program requires the package pyodbc to be installed by pip.

This program requires the Micosoft Access ODBC Drivers 64-Bit Version
which is DownLoadable from the Microsoft WebSite.

A.  Project Description:

      Oftentimes, My Boss would ask me this Question:

     "Who are the B-Day Celebrants for this Month ?"
      so that 
      We will greet them.

      We have about 2,000 Employees in our Company.

      If we were to manually 
      dig our records,
      It would definitely take a long time.

      We decided to use Microsoft Access 2000 with
      filename *.mdb.

      and combine it with

      Python Ver 3.9.16.
 
B.  Methodology: (Thought Process)

      We have to make use of the package pyODBC
      which can be Installed by PIP.

      Additionally, we have to Install the Microsoft Access
      ODBC Drivers for 64-Bit.

      We also have to use the Tkinter as our GUI.
          

C.  Conclusion:

    The file " mudpieproject.py " is a Good Start.

    Although it is Incomplete.

    It is a work in progress,
    There is a lot to be done.
